# Implementation of the FFT Algorithm from Scratch

## About The Project

This project is based on implementing the Fast-Fourier Transform algorithm from scratch. The code is completed using Python as I can utilize it's timer and Numpy's built-in FFT function for comparisons. I first focus on implementing a function for the Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm that my FFT algorithm can be compared to timing wise. I then use a divide-and-conquer algorithm to compute the FFT in O(nlogn) time. In order to ensure that it is fast, I keep a timer to record how long it takes to compute the DFT, FFT, and the built-in Numpy version of FFT. My program will loop through each function 1,000 times and compute the average time it takes each. To promote uniformity and prevent over-complication, the input sizes of all three functions is required to be a power of 2. Therefore, each function will be fed the same random array of 1,024 decimals. This will help to ensure that the FFT function implemented from scratch is faster than the DFT; however, it may not be as fast as Numpy's FFT function, which is permissible.
